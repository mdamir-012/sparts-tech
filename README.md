# sparts-tech

I built the SpArts application using React JS and Tailwind CSS, incorporating some animations for a smooth user experience. SpArts is designed to help you find the best academies for your children. It enables you to select options that promote your child's holistic development and makes it easy to find the right school for your kid.
